## 🎯 Current State Summary

The MVP is **60-70% complete** with core functionality working:

### What Works:

1. ✅ 3D visualization with proper materials
2. ✅ Wall creation tool (click-based)
3. ✅ Element selection and deletion
4. ✅ Material assignment
5. ✅ Properties editing for walls
6. ✅ Expert mode with thermal calculations
7. ✅ Undo/Redo system
8. ✅ Keyboard shortcuts
9. ✅ Demo building
10. ✅ Responsive UI

### What Needs Work:

1. ⚠️ 2D view mode (UI exists but not functional)
2. ⚠️ Transform controls for moving elements
3. ⚠️ Window and Door placement tools
4. ⚠️ Roof creation tool
5. ⚠️ Drag & Drop from library (UI exists but not functional)
